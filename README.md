### Database Schema
The system includes 8 interconnected tables:
- **Airport** - Airport information and locations
- **Airline** - Airline company details
- **Aircraft** - Aircraft fleet owned by airlines
- **Flight** - Flight schedules and routes
- **Passenger** - Passenger personal information
- **Ticket** - Booking and ticket details
- **Employee** - Airport staff information
- **Employee_Address** - Employee address details (1-to-1 relationship)

### Key Relationships
- One-to-One: Employee ↔ Employee_Address
- One-to-Many: Airline → Aircraft, Airport → Flight, Airport → Employee
- Many-to-Many: Passenger ↔ Flight (via Ticket)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Design**: Responsive, Modern UI with gradient themes

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- MySQL Server 8.0+

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airport-management-system.git
cd airport-management-system
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Create Database
Open MySQL Workbench and run:
```sql
SOURCE database/schema.sql;
```

Or manually:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE phase1;
USE phase1;
-- Then copy paste the CREATE TABLE statements from schema.sql
```

### Step 4: Configure Database Connection
Edit `app.py` and update the database credentials:
```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'YOUR_PASSWORD',  # Change this
    'database': 'phase1'
}
```

### Step 5: Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
